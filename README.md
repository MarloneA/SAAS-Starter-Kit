## Features

- **Next.js**: A React framework for production.
- **Shadcn UI**: A set of customizable UI components.
- **Clerk Authentication**: Secure and easy-to-use authentication for your application.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<your-clerk-frontend-api>
CLERK_API_KEY=<your-clerk-api-key>
```

Replace `<your-clerk-frontend-api>` and `<your-clerk-api-key>` with your actual Clerk credentials.

## Usage

### Authentication

This starter kit uses Clerk for authentication. Clerk provides a seamless way to add user authentication to your application. For more details on how to use Clerk, refer to the [Clerk documentation](https://clerk.dev/docs).

### UI Components

Shadcn UI components are used to build the user interface. These components are highly customizable and can be tailored to fit your design requirements. For more details, refer to the [Shadcn UI documentation](https://shadcn.dev/docs).

### Custom Hooks

Custom React hooks are available in the `src/hooks/` directory to help manage state and side effects in your application.

### Contexts

React contexts are used to manage global state, such as user authentication status. These contexts are located in the `src/contexts/` directory.

### Known Issues

###### Error: Cannot access Image.propTypes on the server. You cannot dot into a client module from a server component. You can only pass the imported name through.

This typically happens when you try to use next js Image component directly with next-MDX, not sure why it happened but has been a thing since next 13.3

*fix*: add this code under useMDXComponents custom components
  
```javascript
Image: (props) => <Image {...props}/>
```
